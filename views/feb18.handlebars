    <h2 style="text-align: center;">February 2018: VIX blows and new positions</h2>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;padding: 0;mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #202020;font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 16px;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"> <br>
    Dear investors,<br>
    <br>
    The fund returned +3.5% net of fees and costs in February. The S&P500 lost -3.9% and the ASX200 returned -2.1%. This was largely due to our hedging overlay.<br>
    <br>
    <img data-file-id="2858969" height="139" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/08c26e5e46cf7c109889f7d9d/images/c61cf2c0-4966-49e0-a63e-4917e4e36433.png" style="border: 0px;width: 600px;height: 139px;margin: 0px;outline: none;text-decoration: none;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" width="600"><br>
    <br>
    In January markets were up, but we made money selling them short. In February, markets were down, but our most profitable long was buying the Nasdaq.<br>
    <br>
    Our overlay strategy has now grossed over 10% for the fund since inception. We invested the proceeds in Facebook, Google and Samsung, so the true returns from the early Feb volatility blow-out will include the profits from those.<br>
    <br>
    So not only were investors <em>up</em> when the market was <em>down</em>, but investor ownership of our portfolio companies increased by around 10%. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    One of the more interesting features in markets is the surprise blow-out in Libor. I've read explanations of varying quality, but strange moves in credit markets always bear watching. <br>
    <br>
    The strange chart below shows that the borrowing cost of 350 trillion of debt just became about 0.50% per annum more expensive. That's a lot of cash sucked out of the global economy, <em>on top</em> of the rate rises in the US. <br>
    <img data-file-id="2859153" height="375" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/08c26e5e46cf7c109889f7d9d/images/c4e88458-df5b-4ea5-87c5-1abd98cf1a4b.png" style="border: 0px;width: 600px;height: 375px;margin: 0px;outline: none;text-decoration: none;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" width="600"><br>
    <br>
    We expect leading indicators to turn downwards from here, and are positioning accordingly. Tread carefully. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Strategy Review</strong><br>
    <br>
    You may remember financial news headlines stating the past eighteen months was one of the calmest periods on record. Funny how things change! This put us under plenty of pressure at the time, as we were spending considerable amounts insuring our investors against market turmoil.<br>
    <br>
    However, we stayed the course, knowing that often, the longer markets go without a storm, the fiercer it is when it comes.<br>
    <br>
    A rule of thumb in financial markets is that any trade that pays off in a crash requires a cost to hold the position. Conversely, where there is yield, there is usually the risk of a blow up. It’s not possible to buy catastrophe insurance on a house that you don’t own, but in finance you can, and market storms are extremely common.<br>
    <br>
    In a way, our strategy is to buy the best houses we can find, then purchase insurance policies on those many times over. But I wouldn’t want to push the analogy too far!<br>
    <br>
    Severe market losses tend to involve <em>selling</em> insurance policies. There are many ways to use derivatives to earn dollars today for risk tomorrow. This is why we don't like Sharpe ratios. They are too easy to game (ours is 1.5 net if interested, but don't rely on Sharpes!)<br>
    <br>
    The risks of our approach are the opposite: that we spend too much on hedges, and suffer periods of underperformance, particularly during the times when our stocks and FX move against us. This was largely the scenario behind our dip in April last year.<br>
    <br>
    The good news is that we are generally aware of how much we are spending on hedges at any one time, so we can adjust our positioning accordingly.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Samsung, Facebook and Google</strong><br>
    <br>
    We invested our hedging profits in three megacap companies.<br>
    <br>
    <em>Samsung Electronics</em><br>
    <br>
    Samsung generates 47% of its operating profit from memory hardware, 22% from mobile phones and another 10% from displays. The firm sells the most smartphones globally, but is also a major supplier to Apple. Analysts calculate Samsung makes about $110 for every iPhone X sold through NAND flash and DRAM chips, as well as the OLED screens.<br>
    <br>
    Don’t get lost on what DRAM and NAND are – they are just components of smartphones, computers and cameras. Samsung is the global number one producer of both.<br>
    <br>
    While Apple has announced they will start making their own displays, the firm is less likely to invest in the scale required to make flash memory, which is largely a commodity item. Better to let the suppliers fight it out.<br>
    <br>
    <img data-file-id="2858961" height="363" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/08c26e5e46cf7c109889f7d9d/images/7049043c-2031-4a40-9212-eeec6d248a72.png" style="border: 0px;width: 600px;height: 363px;margin: 0px;outline: none;text-decoration: none;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" width="600"><br>
    <br>
    Memory markets are highly cyclical, with periods of over-then-under supply triggering waves of under-then-over investment. We are now in an opportune moment in the cycle, with major capacity not due until 2019, and demand likely to grow substantially between now and then.<br>
    <br>
    DRAM and NAND production facilities have lead times of 2 years and cost billions. The industry is heavily consolidated, with 3 producers covering 95% of DRAM production, and five major players in NAND. Samsung is number one in both. <br>
    <br>
    No matter who wins the smartphone war, it’s likely that demand for memory will stay strong over the long term. NAND demand is currently growing at 45%.<br>
    <br>
    AI, VR, AR – all these fashionable techy acronyms require more and more memory. As the world’s largest producer, Samsung accrues all the benefits of scale and can position as a low-cost producer of what are largely commodity products.<br>
    <br>
    The firm has traded in a range of 2x to 6x forward EV EBITDA since 2010, and we bought at 2.7x.<br>
     <br>
    <em>Facebook</em><br>
    <br>
    We bought Facebook on a 2020 multiple of under 9x. This was days before scandal broke. It wasn't so long ago Zuck was clumsily preparing a run for President. <br>
    <br>
    Even before the recent Cambridge Analytica news cycle, Facebook was coming under immense regulatory pressure in the EU, the UK and even the US.<br>
    <br>
    Most of us don’t <em>really</em> mind if our data is harvested to serve up product ads. We certainly won’t leave a free platform with all our friends and family. But politics is very different. <br>
    <br>
    Facebook and Zuckerberg became responsible for content the moment they were <em>paid</em> to show it. It’s one thing to be a slow in taking down offensive user-generated content. It’s quite another to take money for it then deny responsibility.<br>
    <br>
    It would be interesting to know if Facebook ever considered banning all political advertising, which would be an easy way to sidestep this entire issue. Apparently they only received $81 million from the Clinton and Trump campaigns. Markets and politics have at least one thing in common: they can turn sane people mad.<br>
    <br>
    As spending moves away from TV-advertising driven consumer giants like Unilever and P&G, and towards independent labels who can build direct relationships with consumers, Facebook, and particularly Instagram, are well positioned to take a slice of all these new companies’ profits. When it comes to digital advertising in the Western world, Facebook and Google are the only real games in town. <br>
    <br>
    On a separate note, it’s becoming clearer that perhaps the US regulators should not have allowed the firm to buy Instagram and Whatsapp. There is a real lack of competition in digital advertising, which at least is good for these firms’ bottom line.<br>
    <br>
    A way to penalize the firm and solve some of these issues would be to break it up and separate Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram. This might well be good for shareholders. <br>
    <br>
    We aim to distil the handful of factors that drive stock prices and, after careful consideration, discard the rest, and the regulatory noise is part of the reason why the company is so cheap. It’s economics that drive returns, and the firm is growing revenues at nearly 50%, with EBITDA margins close to 60%.<br>
    <br>
    Revenue per user is $27 in the US, but only $9 in Europe, and $6 worldwide, so there is still room to grow.<br>
    <br>
    But there are certainly risks. Social networks depend on staying fashionable, and as Snap's recent update that moved brands into the space reserved for friends, there will always be tension between a social network's shareholders and users.<br>
    <br>
    Still, Facebook’s user-base of over 2 billion people is entirely unprecedented in human history, and one of the most extraordinary assets ever built. This position is sized at 1%, but we will consider increasing over the coming months. <br>
    <br>
    <em>Google</em><br>
    <br>
    Google has perhaps the greatest monopoly on the internet, with Amazon being perhaps its only real competitor in search. We bought at ~9x 2020 EV/EBITDA.<br>
    <br>
    In many ways Google has an easier advertising model than Facebook. Users literally tell Google what they want to buy, then Google auctions those user leads to brands accordingly.<br>
    <br>
    Contrast this with Facebook, where users are on the platform to catch up with their friends, rather than to buy something. To serve up effective advertising, Facebook has to build ever more detailed psychological profiles of users and give access to this data to brands.<br>
    <br>
    A very different approach, and creepy to its core. Again, it's really the impact on politics, rather than spending habits, that's so concerning. <br>
    <br>
    Like Facebook, Google was allowed to buy incredibly valuable internet assets. Of particular note is YouTube, which, like Instagram, hosts a horde of ‘influencers’ who can launch a start-up product line into the stratosphere, with a single widely shared video.<br>
    <br>
    There are plenty of reasons not to like these companies, and they should rightly be put under scrutiny. Whatever you think of Google, it too has done the world an enormous amount of good.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Current positioning</strong><br>
    <br>
    After catching a large move in volatility, vol is now richly priced. Fortunately, there are many other ways to protect a portfolio.<br>
    <br>
    We are also increasing our exposure to the USD vs the AUD:<br>
    <br>
    <img data-file-id="2859149" height="393" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/08c26e5e46cf7c109889f7d9d/images/a1cc9fab-0596-4a3f-89d1-2b0cde7520ef.png" style="border: 0px;width: 600px;height: 393px;margin: 0px;outline: none;text-decoration: none;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" width="600"><br>
    <br>
    We are currently hedged in three ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">We have a put spread that could net up to ~10% if the S&P500 drops 10% between now and mid June. This was relatively cheap, about 0.4% per month.</li>
</ol>
This lacks the punch of our usual VIX positioning, but if markets sell off, we should be able to increase our positions when sentiment is negative and valuations are lower.

<ol>
    <li value="2" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">We are short US high yield bonds.</li>
</ol>
Shorting bonds is very different to shorting equities, as your loss is far more limited.<br>
 <br>
Combining short positions in single name credit with long equity investments has a highly attractive asymmetry, and is something we will be doing far more of.<br>
 <br>
You may notice similarities in the chart below to our VIX trade. There is a natural floor, with the potential to ‘blow out’ and generate exceptional returns at important times, such as in 2009, the 2011 euro crisis, and January 2016.<br>
 <br>
<img data-file-id="2858949" height="336" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/08c26e5e46cf7c109889f7d9d/images/9c52d7d2-cc0b-40a5-bc83-a42250896519.png" style="border: 0px;width: 600px;height: 336px;margin: 0px;outline: none;text-decoration: none;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" width="600"><br>
 <br>
 <br>
We haven’t owned bonds since we bought Navios credit at 66c and sold at 90c. But there are interesting plays there too.
<ol>
    <li value="3" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">We are about 8% short single name stocks.</li>
</ol>
In aggregate, our equity shorts have contributed ~o% since inception, a minor outcome. However, as the S&P500 was up 29% over the same period, we were at least able to reduce our equity risk at no portfolio cost.<br>
<br>
<strong>Kodak</strong><br>
<br>
A recent positive example was Kodak. After management announced a prospective ‘Kodakcoin’ the stock jumped nearly fourfold.<br>
<br>
This is a textbook case of why shorting bankrupt companies in their final 1-2 years is such a dicey proposition. A 2-3% short position made before the announcement would have been extraordinarily painful.<br>
<br>
However, <em>after</em> a short squeeze has taken place, there are often good trading opportunities. Every time the share price rises during a squeeze, additional shorts were forced to buy-back shares, causing a new high and more forced buying.<br>
<br>
Eventually the squeeze subsides and the price falls – this is the point that we entered Kodak.<br>
<br>
Such trades also have a clear stop loss – if the stock reaches new highs, that indicates the forced buying has more room to run.  We held the position for 8 days, which is just as well, as at one point the cost to hold this position was quoted at >200% annualized.<br>
<br>
We had the conviction to enter a position slightly larger than 4% - which is a size we would only reach in rare situations for brief periods of time, and even then, only when the trade contributes to the portfolio more broadly. At the end of January, this was a very welcome addition to our portfolio, and we closed our position for a profit of 35%.<br>
<br>

<br>
It was pleasing, at last, to finally make some money out of crypto for our investors.<br>
<br>
